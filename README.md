# Proofed

Proofed is a proofreading application which allows users to easily spell check documents using the Bing Spell Check API. It has been optimized for both desktop and mobile. Please note that this project is shared here to demonstrate my competencies with the languages and technologies, rather than as a practical tool that should be used for large documents. This is because there is a low API limit applied to the app. If you would like to test the app's functionality, please do so with documents containing only a few paragraphs.
